Imported raw cricket statistics and removed any missing or inconsistent values.
Transformed all relevant data into pure numerical format, handling special cases like "Not Out" innings (e.g., converting "7*" to "7").
Filtered and structured the dataset for accurate batting average calculations.
Computed career progression statistics, mapping innings numbers to runs scored
Used Matplotlib to create interactive graphs, plotting Innings Runs (y-axis) vs. Innings Number (x-axis).
Identified trends in performance and consistency between both players.
