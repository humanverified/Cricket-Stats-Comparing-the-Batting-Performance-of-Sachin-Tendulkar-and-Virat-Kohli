# Cricket-Stats-Comparing-the-Batting-Performance-of-Sachin-Tendulkar-and-Virat-Kohli
In this project, I compare the batting performance of two legendary Indian cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, using their career statistics. The analysis focuses on calculating and visualizing the players' batting averages across various innings to gain insights into their consistency and overall performance.
Imported raw cricket statistics and removed any missing or inconsistent values.
Transformed all relevant data into pure numerical format, handling special cases like "Not Out" innings (e.g., converting "7*" to "7").
Filtered and structured the dataset for accurate batting average calculations.
Computed career progression statistics, mapping innings numbers to runs scored
Used Matplotlib to create interactive graphs, plotting Innings Runs (y-axis) vs. Innings Number (x-axis).
Identified trends in performance and consistency between both players.
